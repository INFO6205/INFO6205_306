## Topic
Our topic is to complete a project like TSP with genetic algorithms.</br>
The background is that a traveller wants to visit all the cities and he wants to find the shortest way to complete his trip. After travelling, he will go home.</br>
For example, the traveller's home is (0,0). He wants to visit the other 6 cities (2,3), (2,4), (4,4), (-4,2), (-1,-3),and (3,-1). Our task is helping him to find the shortest way.</br>

In our project, the number of the city will be more. In addition, the home of the traveller can be decided by user. Depending on different start point, there will be different ways.
