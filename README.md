## Topic
    Our topic is to complete a project like TSP with genetic algorithms.
The content of this research project: given a set of randomly generated cities and a distance between each of them, there is a salesman whose job is to visit each of these cities and make a sell, he needs to plan a road so he can try his best to minimize his travel time and miles. He starts from his hometown and he will back to his hometown after work.</br>
For example, the traveller's home is (0,0). He wants to visit the other 20 cities showed on the below chart. Our task is helping him to find the shortest way.</br>

In addition, **the hometown of the traveller can be decided by user**. Depending on different start point, there will be different ways.<br>
So we decide the user interface for users to decide the hometown easily.
